## MechaGrip 
### [Day 1] Motor Hunt Begins  
Spent the whole morning comparing servo motors and stepper torque ratings. Every "perfect" match was either underpowered or overpriced. Landed on a decently powerful NEMA 17 with planetary gearbox. Overkill? Maybe. But MechaGrip deserves torque, not tears.  
**Hours spent:** 3 hours

### [Day 2] Mounting Woes & Disc Drama  
Tried importing the motor disc into Fusion 360  thing was off-centered and kept breaking my constraints. Rebuilt the disc and added a notch for alignment. OCD won.  
**Hours spent:** 2 hours

### [Day 3] Baseplate From Hell  
The robot base was not cooperating. Tried 3 different geometries to reduce print time, weight, and wiring chaos. Landed on a hexagonal structure with central pass-through. Sexy and practical.  
**Hours spent:** 2.5 hours

### [Day 4] Gripper Design = Sleep Loss  
Gripper jaw geometry is an art. My third attempt finally worked parallel jaws with a gear-rack mechanism. Feels like I’m building a vending machine claw that doesn’t suck.  
**Hours spent:** 3 hours

### [Day 5] The Elbow Bends (Finally)  
The elbow link kept clipping into the shoulder. Had to redesign the range stop and swap out a bearing seat. Looks right now. Also added cable routing holes like a nerd.  
**Hours spent:** 2 hours

---

### [Day 6] Shoulder Day  
Made the shoulder beefier after stress-testing. It’s now a swooping, 3D-printable chunk of plastic magic. Built a hollow for a limit switch too, just in case.  
**Hours spent:** 3 hours

---

### [Day 7] BOM Lock & Render  
Sat down and finalized the BOM. Found most parts on Amazon and LCSC. Decided to splurge on a good buck converter and some high-precision bearings. Final model render looks insane.  
**Hours spent:** 2.5 hours
