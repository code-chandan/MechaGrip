## MechaGrip 
### July 10th finding the best motor for my roboarm
so I spent the early hours of july 10th while looking aty some servo and stepper motor charts and, and it was a ton of work, i looked up many websites, almost 30+ sources, this includes yt reddit threads and some datasheets asw. it was tiring, so ye, i finally decided on what mototrs to use, also i learned that the motors capacity is around 9.4 kg/cm which is good enough becvuse im making this only to lift my solder parts and circuit boards, however i will upgrade it in the future, ive attached the image of the motor below !. 

time spent: 3 hours

### July 11th designing the disc and checking compatibilty  
on the evening of july 11th. i worked on the disc of the motors, and it was quite frustrating considering it was my 3rd time building a robot, the dic kept messign with the constraints i had set, but later i had no choice but to delete it all and start from the beggining, after that i tried to assemble it, and i accidently deleted the step file of that disc, and i also emptied my recycle bin, i didnt notice it, but later it was imported onto fusion, so it wasnt a problem, that was it for the disc, it was kinda tough to make, but it is a very important part of the bot.

Time spent: 2 hours

### July 12th Base 
on the morning of july 12th, I starting sowrking on the base of the robot, i tried many shapes, but none seem to be compatible with what i thought of, and i realised why the circular is the og and the best, so finished doing the base and now its rwady for a render

Time spent: 2.5 hours

### July 13th Desighned the gripper
on the morning of 13th july I made a gripper for my robotic arm, the basic idea was just to make it good enough so that it can hold my solder parts and basically hold boards more than anythign else, so i went with the zig zag type design and attached one of the servos so that it works well, this wansnt hard at all, for me the easiest part of building the entire robot was the gripper, although it took more time, it was just for detailing stuff on it, not for functionality, it is perfect

time spent: 3 hours

### July 14th made the elbow bends
on 14th july i made the elbow bends of the robot, basically it was cliping out with the other arm and creating a mess, which i solved pretty quick and my elbow bends were ready, the mistake : i was trying to use fillet on a side that had 2 + constraints which is why it was moving in a specific manner and i couldnt figure that out
but later i did.
what i learnt: like i understood hwo to use the fillet tool and understood how contraints work

time spent: 2 hours

### July 15th Shoulder building
started working ont he shoulders of the robot arm, so the first problem i encountered was that it was way too skinny, i did trial and error with a few measurements, but none worked out, i kept going until i reached this, so i made it look better that what it was, it was skinny as hell.

Time spent: 3 hours, but at least the shoulder’s built like a tank now.

### July 16th made the bom and attached render pics  
today i worked on the bill of materials and took a few pictures of the bom, took some time to check my electronics inventory and check what i have and also finding cheapest parts took some time, the bom was coming upto somewhere around 100$ which is cheaper than most of the robotic arm builds.
also the render looks cool, ive attached the image below.

time spent: 2.5 hrs
