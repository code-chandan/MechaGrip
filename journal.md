## MechaGrip 
### July 10th Motor Hunt Begins  
Honestly, I spent my whole morning deep diving into servo motors and stepper torque stats, and it was a STRUGGLE. Every time I thought I found the one, it was either weak AF or way too pricey. In the end, I just went with an MG996R Servo Motor with a planetary gearbox â€˜cause it packs a punch. Is it extra? 100%. But honestly, MechaGrip deserves all the torque, no room for disappointment here.

Low-key flex: 3 hours of my life gone, but I did it for the grip.

### July 11th Mounting Woes & Disc Drama  
Tried dropping the motor disc into Fusion 360 and it was a full on mess thing was off center and kept breaking my constraints. Ended up just scrapping it and rebuilding from scratch, plus I added a little notch for alignment because my OCD couldnâ€™t let it slide ðŸ™ƒ. Perfectionist mode: activated.

Time lost: 2 hours, but at least my sanity is intact.

### July 12th Baseplate From Hell  
Bro, the robot base was straight up not vibing with me. Messed around with three different shapes to make the print faster, lighter, and not a total wiring nightmare. Finally went with that hexagonal base and added a central pass through looks fire and actually works.

Time lost: 2.5 hours, but at least itâ€™s now both a looker and a functional legend.

### July 13th Gripper Design = Sleep Loss  
Designing the gripper jaws was straight-up an art project. Took me three attempts before I finally nailed it with parallel jaws and a gear rack setup. Low key feels like Iâ€™m crafting a vending machine claw except this one actually works and wonâ€™t embarrass me.

Hours lost: 3, but hey, now I got a gripper that pulls its weight.

### July 14th The Elbow Bends (Finally)  
The elbow link just kept beefing with the shoulder constant clipping drama. So I went full engineer, redesigned the range stop, swapped out the bearing seat, and now it finally looks like a real mech arm. 
Time sacrificed: 2 hours. Worth it for the smooth joints.

### July 15th Shoulder Day  
Had to buff up the shoulder.

Time sunk: 3 hours, but at least the shoulderâ€™s built like a tank now.

### July 16th BOM Lock & Render  
Sat down and finalized the BOM. Found most parts on Amazon. Final model render looks insane.  
Time sunk: 2.5 hours
